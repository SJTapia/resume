# Experience
In terms of my work experience, I like to think that I'm pretty dedicated. The first job I ever really had I started when I was around 18 and remained for over 10 years. With the arrival of COVID mixed with some personal reasons, I decided to leave that company and focus on not only improving my life but also improving myself. This reasoning is why I enrolled back into school and am commited to finding a new home with a company that will invest as much into me as I will into them; if that's you, give me a call!
