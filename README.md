# Experience
In terms of my work experience, I like to think that I'm pretty dedicated. The first job I ever really had I started when I was around 18 and remained for over 10 years. With the arrival of COVID mixed with some personal reasons, I decided to leave that company and focus on not only improving my life but also improving myself. This reasoning is why I enrolled back into school and am commited to finding a new home with a company that will invest as much into me as I will into them; if that's you, give me a call!

### Alorica 
- Deposits Operation Specialist
  - August 2022 to Current
- **Responsibilities:**
  - I could type up a bunch of fancy things about what I do, but in essence I take phone calls for a bank and act as a bank teller. This position does currently afford me the opportunity to learn plenty abount managing finances, handling difficult personalitiesy, managing a heavy workload, and finding ways to increase efficiences in every day processes.

### Teleperformance USA
- Julyish of 2010 to April of 2022
- I carried many positions throughout my tenure with this company. Here's a list:
  1. Benefit Advocate
  2. Learning and Development Specialist 
  3. Learning Captain (this was a fun way to say lead trainer/assistant training manager)
  4. Operations Supervisor
  5. Assistant Contact Center Manager 

- **Responsibilities:**
  - I did a lot, honestly. I worked primarily within a department that assisted medicare eligible individuals with their private insurance plans. I probably know way more about medicare health insurance than most people and I'm pretty greatful for that. I handled benefit inquiries, questions about billing and medical claims, prescription information, and so much more. I was really good at this and quickly moved up to becoming a trainer, where I then shared my knowledge with new hires, then I was asked to become the lead trainer. Once in that position, I was again asked to become a supervisor and then asked to apply to become one of the assistant mangers (we had about three total at the time due to the heavy headcount we carried).
