# Cover Letter
Hey, I would like to start off by thanking you for visiting my online resume. I know that you most likely have plenty to review throughout this hiring process and taking some extra time to review this page may not be the most ideal. My hope is that in utilizing this resource (rather than just reviewing the submitted resume document) you'll have an opportunity to not only get to know my personality a bit, but that it will also save you a bit of time in comparison to reading boring file after boring file. 

To start, I'd like to provide a bit of information about myself. I consider my upbringing to be a bit unique (at least in comparison to individuals I've met). I grew up in a three bedroom home that housed seven people, which was definitely a struggle at times. The thing that I consider most unique about my upbringing, though, is that my mother's side of the family was raised in England while my father's side was raised in Mexico. I feel like this allowed me to develop an interesting perspective on life and society as a whole. My father and grandmother were both incredibly hard workers who did not seem to understand the concept of a day off work and I like to think this was a lesson I picked up well.......[_note to self: finish out cover letter_]
