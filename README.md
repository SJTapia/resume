# Extracurricular

[Return to cover letter](https://github.com/SJTapia/resume/tree/main)

With being in school and trying to work full time, I haven't really been able to find a lot of opportunity to take on any extracurricular activities. I do, however, have one that I just can't find it in me to let go of:

#### JoMoCon Committee:
- I am on the board of a non-profit set-up here in Joplin, MO. Our aim is to share out love and passion for all nerdom (anime, fantasy, sci-fi, etc) in the form of a convention experience aimed towards families and individuals who might not otherwise have the opportunity to add a convention. We also want to try and promote the culture and community of Joplin and the surrounding area. We select and partner with one local charity each year to donate proceeds. So far we have hosted two events and have raised funds for our local Hearts & Hammers chapter and the Ozark Center's Turnaround Ranch.

You can find more information about us [here](https://www.jomocon.org).

And here's our logo
